#### Proof of Duplicate Existence Using the Pigeonhole Principle

##### Problem Statement
* Given an array `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]`, prove that at least one duplicate number exists.

###### -  Using the pigeon hole principle, we can conculde that as, there are only `[1, n]`, 'n' numbers to fill and 'n+1' spaces, we will have one number which repeats itself.
