How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
-> using the pigeon hole principle, we can conculde that as, there are only [1, n], 'n' numbers to fill and 'n+1' spaces, we will have one number which repeats itself.
